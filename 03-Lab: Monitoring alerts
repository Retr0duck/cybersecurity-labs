there are information so important, we can check the file that is malicious the name in this case is edit1-invoice.docm
and The document contains a macro in `ThisDocument.cls` that triggers when the InkEdit control named `GBjdshuiKJ` receives focus.
The `InkEdit1_GotFocus` subroutine executes a shell command. The command to be executed is retrieved from the `TextBox1` control located on `UserForm1`. 
The shell command is executed with the window style set to 0, which corresponds to a hidden window. This means that upon gaining focus, 
the InkEdit control will execute a command retrieved from a textbox on a user form,
without displaying a window.

with this information we can be sure that this file is malicious.
