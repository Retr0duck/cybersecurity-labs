    Another classic phishing technique were this mail try to look legite and safe but is not how it looks.


### Step 1:
    In this lab we are gonna work with a file with ".eml" extension and that's all the files, we need to analize and file, i reccomend to read the file only with cat or gress
    don't open directly the file, this maybe contain malicious scripts. So first of all we need to find the sending email address, i recommend to view all the file with cat
    for context, but directly we can find it like this.
