In this lab we are gonna work with a document .zip where we can find 4 documents:
 Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
  6032687  2022-02-12 19:31   Bruteforce_Challenge.csv
    69632  2022-02-12 19:29   Bruteforce_Challenge.evtx
  6032687  2022-02-12 19:31   Bruteforce_Challenge.txt
      360  2022-02-12 19:35   README.txt
---------                     -------
 12135366                     4 files

This files are maded for different types of devices ther first 3 files are evidence and hystory of logins or attempts of login.
The files are secure but always use the file command to check the type of command, in my case i'm using linux, so use:
> file file.txt
> ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
ok now we got all to start, the first question is:

1- How many Audit Failure events are there? (Format: Count of Events)
To know the response open a terminal, go to the folder where is the file and execute this command: 
└─$ grep -i 'Audit Failure' BTLO_Bruteforce_Challenge.txt | wc -l
> 4011
So the answer is 4011

then the second question is:
2- What is the username of the local account that is being targeted?
We can check this using the function grep and a keyword, normally i use this:
└─$ grep -i 'Account Name:' BTLO_Bruteforce_Challenge.txt        
> Admin

3- What is the Windows Event ID associated with these logon failures?
This is easy, is Event ID 4625 — An account failed to log on, but we can read the files and you will find the event ID.

5- What is the source IP conducting this attack? (Format: X.X.X.X)
We can check this viewing the files or with grep executing this:
└─$ grep -i 'Source Network Address' BTLO_Bruteforce_Challenge.txt
>         Source Network Address: 113.163.194.229 - is the answer

6- What country is this IP address associated with? (Format: Country)
Use the ip in a web like https://ipgeolocation.io/ or other site but this shows data about the source ip address
the answer is China

7- What is the range of source ports that were used by the attacker to make these login requests?

My solution was use grep and sort all the ports like this
└─$ grep -i "Source port" BTLO_Bruteforce_Challenge.txt | awk '{print $NF}' | sort -n
This will give a response of all the ports but sorted.
The final response: 49162-65534
