# 🧪 **First Lab: Phishing Analysis**

---

## 🛠️ **Tools Required**
- 🖥️ **VM with NAT connection** (Recommended: Linux for security and internet access)
- 🖳 **Terminal**
- 🧑‍💻 **Basic Linux Commands**

---

## 🕵️ **Lab Scenario**
> **You’ve received a suspicious email file (`.eml`). Your mission:**  
> Analyze its contents to detect phishing indicators using a secure environment.

---

## ⚡ **Quick Start**
```diff
+ Always use a VM and NAT for internet safety and isolation.
```

1. **Download** the lab archive (e.g., `.zip`) and extract it.
2. **Navigate** to your workspace:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads/lab/analysis
    ```
3. **Identify the file type:**
    ```bash
    file EmailLegite
    ```
    > Example Output:  
    > `Website contact form submission.eml: SMTP mail, ASCII text, with very long lines (429), with CRLF line terminators`

---

## 🔍 **Step-by-Step Analysis**

### 1️⃣ **Find the Primary Recipient**
```bash
cat EmailLegite
```
Look for header fields like `To:` or similar.  
> Example: `2222:a0c:aa16:0:0:0:0:0`

---

### 2️⃣ **Extract the Subject Line**
```bash
grep -i "^Subject:" EmailLegite
```
> Output:  
> `Subject: Contact important`

---

### 3️⃣ **Get the Email Date**
```bash
grep "^Date:" EmailLegite
```
You can also read all headers with `cat` for deeper inspection.

---

### 4️⃣ **Locate the Originating IP**
```bash
grep -i "Received:" EmailLegite
```
> Example (not actual answer):  
> `Receiver IP: 102,10.10`

---

### 5️⃣ **Reveal the Hostname**
```bash
grep -i "Hostname" EmailLegite
```
> Output:  
> `X-AntiAbuse: Primary Hostname - c9s0-4w-zae.hosting-services.net.au`

---

### 6️⃣ **Check the Filename & Find URLs**
- **List files:**
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
- **Check file type:**
    ```bash
    file EmailLegite
    ```
- **Extract URLs:**
    ```bash
    grep -o 'http[s]*://[^"]*' EmailLegite
    ```
> URLs often point to sites like Blogspot or similar platforms.

---

### 7️⃣ **Where is it Hosted?**
Check the URLs found above; look for hosting services or suspicious platforms.
